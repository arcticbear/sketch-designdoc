# sketch-designdoc :cat::dog:

This plugin exports a very simple website using the Sketch document to hold the structure, images and text of it.

## Demo 
You have a Sketch sample file [here](https://github.com/mamuso/sketch-designdoc/raw/master/sample_doc.sketch), and a demo of the exported site [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8274/designdoc/index.html).

## TODOs and Known Issues
- The current website template is pretty bad.
- The plugin and the output need a more intensive test. 

## Settings

## Document Structure

## Exporting
