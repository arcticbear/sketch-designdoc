# Sketch Design Doc :chicken::dog:
This plugin exports a simple website using a bunch of conventions and the Sketch document as the structure. We named the plugin "design doc" because initially, we used it to export a design guideline, but we have been using it for many other things.

If you want to see an example, you can build [this website](http://mamuso.github.io/sketch-designdoc/Chicken/Chicken/) using this [Sketch file](https://github.com/mamuso/sketch-designdoc/raw/master/examples/Chicken/Chicken.sketch) as a base.

## How to Install
1. Download and open [```sketch-designdoc-master.zip```](https://github.com/mamuso/sketch-designdoc/archive/master.zip)
2. Open ```DesignDoc.sketchplugin```
3. Done! :dancer:
